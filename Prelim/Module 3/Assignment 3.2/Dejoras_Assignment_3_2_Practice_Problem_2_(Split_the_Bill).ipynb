        "In the Splitwise app, people form groups and add the expenses of members of the group. This is especially useful for vacations, where people traveling in a group can maintain an account of their expenses and who paid the bills.\n",

        "All people in the group are assigned distinct IDs between 1 and N, where N is the size of the group.\n",

        "Each transaction has the following parameters:-\n",
        "<br> <br>\n",
        "transaction_id - It is a string representing the unique ID by which the transaction is identified.\n",
        "paid_by - It is a list of lists, where each element of the list is another list having the form [x, y]. Here, x and y denote that person having ID x paid Rs. y.\n",
        "split_as - It is a list of lists, where each element of the list is another list having the form [x, y]. Here, x and y denote that after all dues are settled, a person having ID x will ultimately contribute Rs. y to the transaction.<br> <br>\n",
